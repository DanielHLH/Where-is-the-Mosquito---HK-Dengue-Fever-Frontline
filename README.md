# Where-is-the-Mosquito---HK-Dengue-Fever-Frontline
It is an independent project of collecting Ovitrap Index data from Hong Kong Government to understand the extensiveness of the distribution of Aedine mosquitoes.
This project is completed from collecting and organizing data from the Ovitrap Index document and website of Hong Kong Food and Environmental Department, to creating a relational database for the organized data and visualising the data. 
For anyone who would like to use the AreaOvitrap.db database for their own analysis, you are welcome to download it. It is a SQLite database thus it is ready to be used when the download is completed.
